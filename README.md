# Identifying key patterns and factors (platform, genre, rating, region and lifecycle) for video game sales
Identify patterns that determine whether a game is successful. This will enable you to detect promising projects and plan advertising campaigns.

## Technologies used
-Language: Python.
-Key Libraries:
  - Pandas and NumPy: Data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation.
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization (trends, distributions, regional analysis).
  - SciPy & statsmodels: Implementation of Independent Samples T-Tests and Proportions Z-Tests for statistical hypothesis validation.

## Relevant graphs
-Platform lifecycle chart (Line Plot): Shows the strong sales peak that occurs 2 to 3 years after a console launch and its rapid decline, defining the critical window of opportunity for the business.

Regional bar Charts by Genre (Comparative Bar Charts): Demonstrate the marked contrast in genre preferences by region (e.g., Role-Playing Dominance in Japan vs. Action/Shooter in North America/Europe), justifying the regionalization strategy.

Scatter Plot of Sales vs. Critic Scores: Illustrates the weak positive correlation between overall sales and critic scores, validating the conclusion that external business factors (marketing, platform) are more important for commercial success.

## Results and conclusions
According to statistical and exploratory analysis, the most important factors for improving sales and achieving commercial success are:

Strict Regionalization Strategy: Companies must stop treating the global market as a single entity. Investment in role-playing games is critical for success in Japan, while action and shooter games should be prioritized in North America and Europe.

Maximizing Platform Lifecycle: Marketing and promotional efforts should be heavily concentrated in the first two to three years after a console or platform launch, as this is the only window of opportunity for maximizing sales.

Focus on External Factors (Non-Score Drivers): Given the weak correlation with ratings, companies should strategically invest in advertising, platform exclusivity agreements, and leveraging the size of the target platform's user base, as these business factors are more influential on commercial success than the mere opinion of the average critic or user.
